# updatedPortfolio

## Description

* This is my third portfolio update. For this update:

    * I added icons with links to my updated Linkedin, GitHub account, and developer gmail. 

    * I added a link on the navigation with an updated resume.

    * I updated my biography and added a portfolio photo of myself. 

* I completely renovated my portfolio page from my initial submission. I wanted to experiment with incorporating animation and motion design, while keeping the style minimalistic with a bold color palette. 

* I will probably adjust the landing page a bit more from here on out, as I am not satisfied with how the blobs line up on mobile. The hamburger navigation bar also still needs a bit of work. 


## Core Objectives Met

* Updated portfolio featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks.

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks. Including biography, developer e-mail, and link to deployed portfolio, 2 pinned repositories with README.md and MIT license. 

* Updated resume.

* Updated LinkedIn profile.
