# updatedPortfolio

## Description

* This is my second updated portfolio with links to my updated Linkedin and GitHub accounts. 

* I completely renovated my portfolio page from my initial submission. I wanted to experiment with incorporating animation and motion design, while keeping the style minimalistic with a bold color palette. 

* For the final submission, I need to: add in a biography, and a professional-looking (non-selfie) picture in the 'about' section. I plan on working on the landing page a bit more, as I am finding out I prefer CSS grid > Flexbox and am not satisfied with the way the font is laid out.   


## Core Objectives Met

* Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Submit an updated resume.

* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile.
